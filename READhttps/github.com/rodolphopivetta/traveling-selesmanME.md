# Traveling Salesman solved by Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains a implementation of two algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman problem:

* Simulated Annealing
* Genetic Algorithm

This work compares the implementations, so the ```tsp.py``` file executes the random generation of cities and uses this collection to send to the algorithms.

## Dependencies

To run this code, you need to install the matplotlib. 

``` sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib ``` 

## Execution

To execute, just call

``` python tsp.py ```

This will show three graphs, first with the initial and final tours to Simulated Annealing and the second for Genetic Algoritm. The third graph shows the comparision of the executions.

This repository have too a report (in Brazilian Portuguese) of this implementations and the results of observations.
